# Express SSE Example

A beginner-friendly example demonstrating how to implement **Server-Sent Events (SSE)** using **Express.js**. This project helps developers understand the basics of SSE and how it can be used for real-time data updates in a web application.

---

## Features

- **Real-Time Data Updates**: Use SSE to send updates from the server to the client without polling.
- **Simple and Lightweight**: Built with minimal dependencies to keep things straightforward.
- **Beginner-Friendly**: Clean and easy-to-understand codebase with comments.

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up and run the project locally:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/amdsaad/sse-express-js.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd sse-express-js
   ```

3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Start the server:

   ```bash
   node app.js
   ```

5. Open `index.html` in your browser to see SSE in action.

---

## Usage

- The `app.js` file contains a simple Express server that sends real-time updates to connected clients.
- Open the `index.html` file in your browser to establish an SSE connection and receive data updates from the server.
